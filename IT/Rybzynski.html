<p>Factors prices are insensitive. That is factor prices do not change with respect to change in the factor endowments.</p>

<div class="bg-note pad givemarginx" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000"><h4>Intuition behind the Factor price insensitivity</h4>
<p>When labour endowment increases (capital constant), the output of the labour intensive sector expands and the output of the capital intensive industry will contract.</p>
<p>Therefore the factors in the capital intensive will be taken  out of the production and will be employed in labour intensive industry.</p>
<p>Thus the capital labour intensity ratio \(a_{iL} \over a_{iK}\) in both industries remains constant.</p>

<h2>Change in Endowments</h2>

<p>To see this we will totally differentiate the full employment conditions:</p>
$$ a_{1L}dY_1 + a_{2L}dY_2 = dL $$
$$ a_{1K}dY_1 + a_{2K}dY_2 = dK $$

<p>Here we are keeping product prices constant. Therefore \(a_{iL}\) and \(a_{iK}\) are constant.</p>

<p>Expansion in the labour intensive sector is more than the expansion in labour endowment because the output of the other sector has contracted. </p>
