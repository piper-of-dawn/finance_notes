        There cannot be a FPI lemma in a closed economy. FPI says that factor endowments can increase without affecting the factor prices. $$ =\frac{\delta_{k k}}{s_{k}}+s_{k}-1, \quad \text { if } k=l \\ =\frac{\delta_{k l}}{s_{k}}+s_{l}, \quad \text { if }
        k \neq l $$ Change in Endowment of labour has no impact on change of capital.
        <p>We get these two expressions for \(frac{\partial \ln w_{k}}{\partial \ln V_{l}}\)</p>
        <p>There are two cases here: \(\delta_{kk}\) is the regression coefficient.

<p>    Germany is a very bank oriented economy that is the banks are allowed to lend as well as hold equities in the firms whereas in United States there is a restriction on both the activities.</p>


<p>
    
        Rajan and Zingales conclude that the distinction between market oriented economies and Bank oriented economies is very clear in the type of financing that is used.  Bank oriented economies go for more of a private financing (which cannot be traded)  such as bank loans. such as which cannot be traded in the stock market, whereas Market oriented economies go for more of a public financing (bond markets) which can be publically traded.

       However note that this is not useful in explaining leverage. Debt is debt no matter if it is publicly traded  or not publicly traded.

<div id = "Threat of takeover" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">


<p>    In United States United Kingdom and Canada the threat of takeover is very credible because of the diffused ownership structure.  In Japan and Continental Europe the ownership structure is highly concentrated. Rajan and Zingales find that ownership or manager-owner dynamics do not impact leverage because both the opposite forces are at play here:</p>
<ol>
    
    <li>    When shareholders are in board of directors that is active part of management, then they will facilitate equity issues.</li>
     <li>
            
             On the other hand if shareholders are banks,  then they will be against private financing and will force their clients to borrow.
