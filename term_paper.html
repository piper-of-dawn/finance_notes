<h2>Question 1</h2>

<strong>The fact that many empirical papers attempting to explain cross sectional variation in returns find that small stocks and high book to market stocks have higher average returns implies that the traditional CAPM is of no relevance whatsoever.</strong>


<p>This statement is <strong>UNCERTAIN</strong></p>
<h6>Why this statement holds?</h6>

<p>There is no doubt that empirical record of CAPM is very poor.</p>
<p>Researchers have found many variables on prices such as \(\text{Earnings} \over \text{Price}\) or any \(X \over P\) that could explain returns. Thus, the CAPM falls completely apart. this shows that \(\beta\)s are not the sole coefficient explaining returns.</p>
<p>
    This becomes even more complex when perspective of Behaviorists are taken into account and they bring model into fundamental trouble.
  

<p>Thus, CAPM's relevance becomes questionable.</p>
<h6>Why this statement does not hold?</h6>
<p>Before reaching a conclusion whether "CAPM is of no relevance whatsoever", we need to agree upon that CAPM has been conclusively and rigorously tested with the most appropriate data.</p>

<p>Researchers have argued that the CAPM has never been conclusively tested. The empirical test either use proxies or restrict the sample to include financial assets only. CAPM says that the risk of a stock should be measured relative to a comprehensive market portfolio that so the sample should not be limited to traded financial assets only but also consumer durables, real estate and human capital which motivates something called consumption based CAPM. Then there is another version of CAPM called ICAPM which adds time dimension to CAPM saying that different investors have different valuation for future return.</p>

<p>Although the three factor model of Fama and French is a classic and robust work which highlights that firm size and book to market equity explain returns on securities thus raising questions on validity of CAPM but one must realise that this is a bruteforce methodology while CAPM is something that is theoretically grounded in first principles.</p>

<p>
    
    The substance of the argument here is that before one argues something as far as "CAPM is useless", one has to give conclusive answers regarding how the CAPM has been tested against data.

<h2>Question 3</h2>

<p><strong>There would be no serious problems encountered in interpreting the results of an event study whose sample size is small and the event window is large.</strong></p>

<p>This statement is <strong>FALSE</strong></p>

<p>This statement deals with two specific issues: 
    <li>Size of the event window</li>
    <li>Sample size which can also be treated equivalent to the level of granularity of data</li>
</p>

<p>Let us see each of them in detail: </p>

<h4>1) Size of the event Window: </h4>
<br>
<strong> Markets are efficient.</strong> This is the baseline assumption of conducting an event study and we have to agree upon that prices reflect all the available information.</p>
    
    <p>So if markets are efficient, the event windows should be reasonably small, because when we assume efficiency we apriori assume that investors will act upon any new information as soon as it becomes public.</p>
    
    <p>Therefore an event is anything that generates new information and this information makes the market deviate from efficiency. So till the null hypothesis is accepted, the event study acts as a testament for the theory of market efficiency. But when the  is rejected we actually don't know where the problem is. There could be anomalies that is markets are not efficient or normal returns as calculated by CAPM is wrong. If the effects of events are not realized within a short period of time it is the obligation of the researcher to explain this.</p>
<p>The other practical problem that comes up because of a long event window is controlling for confounding events. In a longer time span, there might occur several events which might have the same impact as the event under question. So it will become very difficult to isolate the impact of the event under study.</p>

<h4>2) Sample size: </h4>

<p>A low sample size is not a good thing to have in any empirical study. A low sample size reduces the power of a statistical test and might also cause issues such as sampling bias. Another practical difficulty with a low sample size is it will be very difficult to explain the cross-sectional differences among firms. Each event might impact different firms in different ways. And if our sample size is low in the first place, the classification of firms into groups will further lower a low sample size. 
<p><strong>However it should be noted that, the question of what granularity of time series data should a event study use is not trivial question.</strong> Most event studies have used closing price of stocks. Using a less granular data will reduce the power of the test whereas using highly granular data such as daily or an hourly data will end up modelling noise rather than signal. Hence this argument should be taken with a slight caution that is a low sample size is bad but a researcher shouldn't go overboard with increasing the sample size to an extent that the results stop making sense altogether. </p>

<h2>Question 4</h2>
<p>
    
    <strong>    
        For a firm facing finance constraints (arising due to asymmetric information and agency costs), the shadow cost of to the firm of uncollateralized external financing always exceeds that of internal financing.
    </strong>
</p>

<p>This statement is <strong>TRUE</strong></p>

<p>To make sense of this statement, we need to be clear with the costs associated with internal and external finance
<p>I will outline my argument with the help of the following diagram:</p>
<p><img src="assets\camimp.svg"></p>
<p>Here demand curve reflects the investment opportunities and supply curves are the functions of thr net-worth of the investor.</p>
<h4>Cost of internal and external finance</h4>
<h6>Cost of internal finance:</h6>
<p>The entrepreneur with net-worth \(W_0\) has the choice of investing \(W_o\) at the interest \(r\).​ Hence the future value of the opportunity cost of undertaking this investment project is \(W_o(1+r)\). That is if he invests this money in the capital market he would get  \(W_o(1+r)\). Therefore, a risk neutral investor will go ahead with the investment project only if output less payments to external investors exceeds \(W_o(1+r)\).​    
</p>    
<h6>Cost of external finance:</h6>
<p>In a perfect capital market where there are absolutely no informational assymetries, there wouldn't exist any informational cost. The external funds would be as good as internal funds. Hence the supply curve should be a horizontal straight line at \(r\) as shown in the diagram. But the investors cannot perfectly monitor the actions of the entrepreneur. For example: expenditures on hard capital are observable but expenditure on soft capital is not. If entrepreneur buys a machinery can be observed but expenditure on managerial ability cannot be observed. The entrepreneur may be tempted to divert soft capital funds to personal gain. Hence investors need to be compensated for this risk. And this is shown by a kink in the supply and its upward movement henceforth from the point \(W_0\).  
</p>  

<p>The interpretation is, for every marginal increase in investment from external source the external investor needs to be compensated for the risk that it brings. Hence the positive slope of the supply curve, make the price of risk \(> r\). </p>

<p>Therefore, financial Constraint here implies the inability of firms to move to the preferred level of capital stock \(K^*\) due informational cost faced by entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Hence YES, it is true if informational asymmetries exist the external funds are costlier than internal funds.</p>

<h2>Question 5</h2>

<strong>Studies incorporating influences of information and incentive problems in the investment process have retained the assumption of a representative firm thereby arguing that firm heterogeneities are likely to be unimportant.</strong>

<p>This statement is <strong>FALSE</strong></p>

<p>When we talk about a representative firm we need to agree that ALL the firms face the same environment, information and incentives as a representative firm faces. However, in reality this statement is not correct.</p>


<p>Most theoretical work does not assign any relevance to financial factors such as Book to Market equity ratio, Gearing ratio etc. For example: CAPM does not assign any importance to anything except \(\beta\).</p>
<p>But in reality, investment is sensitive to financial factors and these financial factors might not be constant across firms and might differ. And given that we are in a world of imperfect information, the informational cost for firms might itself differ. 
    <p>One of the testament of this is the work of Fazzari, Hubbard and Peterson (1988) paper.</p>
    <p> FHP(1988) group the firms into two categories, controlling for investment opportunities that is Tobin's Q:        
        <li>High information costs</li>
        <li>Low information costs</li>
    </p>
    
<p>These heterogeneities among the firms become all the more apparent when FHP(1988) implement the firm classification by retention behaviour FHP group firms into three categories i.e. high, medium and low dividend payout firms and estimate the following panel data regression <strong>with firm level fixed effects.</strong>: 


    $${I \over K}_{it} = a_i + b \ Q_{it} + c \ ({CF \over K})_{it} +\epsilon_{it} $$


    <ul>
        <li>\({I \over K}_{it}\) is investment for firm \(i\) at time \(t\).</li>
        <li>\(a_i\) is the firm-level fixed effect.</li>
        <li>\({Q}_{it}\) is the Tobin's Q for firm \(i\) at time \(t\).</li>
        <li>\({CF \over K}_{it}\) is the cashflow (net worth) for firm \(i\) at time \(t\).</li>
        <li>\(\epsilon_{it}\) is white noise.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The coefficient \(c\) should not be significantly different from zero to imply a frictionless
        world. If \(c\) is significant then capital market imperfections exist. \(a_i\) represents
        firm level fixed effects which are time-invariant.</p>

</p>

<p>The findings are as follows:</p>
<p>FHP found a significant \(c\) in all the three groups.</p>
<p>FHP found significantly larger estimated cashflow coefficient for low dividend payout firms. That is controlling for Q (investment opportunities), \(I \over K\) is influenced more by cashflow (\(c\)) is higher for low dividend payout firms.This result makes an intuitive sense as low dividend payout firms retain profits because they are financially constrained.</p>

<p>Hence we can conclude that in an imperfect world with informational asymmetries, the firms aren't homogenous and we cannot rely upon the assumption of a representative firm and the empirical models must account for them. </p>
