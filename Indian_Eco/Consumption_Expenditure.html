<h2>Difference between mixed and uniform reference periods</h2>

<h3>URP</h3>
<p> Lets say you are asked the consumption expenditure on everything for the last 30 days. It becomes the uniform reference period. This will include non-perishable durables as well which will be consumed over a long period of time. 
</p>

<h3>MRP</h3>
<p>Lets say you are asked the consumption expenditure on some perishable items such as food for the last 30 days (30 day recall) and the expenditure on non-perishable / durable items for the last 365 days. The expenditure on durables is normalised to 30 days. Here we are mixing two reference periods, hence it is known as mixed reference period.
</p>

<h3>MMRP</h3>
<p>MRP is slightly modified here. Consumption expenditure on some perishable items such as food for the last 7 days (weekly recall) which will then be normalised to 30 days, the expenditure on certain items with a 30 day recall, which remains as it is and the expenditure on non-perishable / durable items for the last 365 days which is is normalised to 30 days.

<div class="bg-note pad givemarginx" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000"><h4>68th round of NSS</h4>
<p> The questionnaire was segregated into two types, Type I and Type II. In Type I we have URP and MRP, in Type II we have URP, MRP and MMRP. </p>
