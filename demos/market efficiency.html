      <h3></h3><strong>Efficiency in Financial Markets</strong></h3>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prices are always forward looking.</li>
        <hr>
        <h5>Prices look at adjustment in response to three information subsets:</h5>

        <li><strong>Weak form tests: </strong> Historical information.</li>
        <li><strong>Semi strong form tests: </strong> Other information which is publicly available.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong form tests: </strong>Do some investors have a monopolistic access to information relevant to
          price information.</li>
        <hr>
      </ul>
      </p>


      <h3><strong>What do we mean by fully reflect?</strong></h3>
      <p>Notationally it can be written as:
        $$ E(\tilde{p}_{j,t+1}|\Phi_t) = [1+E(\tilde{r}_{j,t+1}|\Phi_t)]p_{j,t} $$
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>\(p_{j,t}\) is the price of the security \(j\) at time \(t\)</li>
        <li>\(p_{j,t+1}\)is the price of the security \(j\) at time \(t+1\).</li>
        <li>\(\Phi_t\) is the information available at time \(t\).</li>
        <li>\(\tilde{r}_{j,t+1}\) = \({p_{j,t+1} - p_{j,t}} \over p_{j,t}\) </li>
        <li>\(~\) superscript denotes a random variable. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is some theory that relates the available information under uncertainty to the expected return at the
        time \(t+1\) i.e \(E(\tilde{r}_{j,t+1}|\Phi_t)\).</p>
      <p>The expectations are formed on the basis of \(\Phi_t\) have a major empirical implication. This can be seen
        when we apply the fair game property.</p>


      <h3><strong>Fair Game</strong></h3>

      <p>Let \(\alpha (\Phi) = [ \alpha_1 (\Phi_t), \alpha_2 (\Phi_t)...... \alpha_n (\Phi_t) ] \) be a trading system
        where \(\alpha_j (\Phi_t)\) represent the funds invested in the \(j_{th}\) security. </p>

      <p>We can write excess value or profits generated by such a system as:
        $$ V_{t+1} = \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_1 (\Phi_t) (\tilde{r}_{j,t+1} - E(\tilde{r}_{j,t+1} | \Phi_t)) $$
      </p>
      <p>Applying the fair game property we get:
        \(\tilde{r}_{j,t+1} = E(\tilde{r}_{j,t+1} | \Phi_t)\).
      </p>
      <p>This implies: \(V_{t+1} = 0\)</p>
      <P> In the fair game model:
      <ol>

        <li>The conditions for market expectations can be stated in terms of expected returns.</li>
        <li>The information \(\Phi_t\) is fully utilized while forming equilibrium expected returns.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <P>On e property of the fair game model </P>

      <div class="bg-lightgrey pad givemarginx">
        <h4>Martingale:</h4>
        <p> It is a sequence of random variables (stochastic process) in which the conditional expectation of the next
          value is equal to its present value. </p>
        <h4>Submartingale:</h4>
        <p> It is a sequence of random variables (stochastic process) in which the conditional expectation of the next
          value is more than or equal to its present value. </p>
      </div>


      <h3><strong>\(\mathrm{I. }\) The Submartingale Model</strong></h3>
      <p>We assume that the price sequence of the security \(j\) that is \(E(\tilde{p}_j,1+1 | \Phi_t)\) follows a
        submartingale. This is because investor will only invest in expectation of a positive payoff.</p>

      <p>If the fair game property as stated in the equation \(E(\tilde{r}_{j,t+1} | \Phi_t = 0)\) holds then price
        sequence follows a martingale.</p>

      <div class="bg-sweetyellow pad givemarginx">

        <p>If the price sequence follows a submartingale property, then any trading strategy would generate the same
          positive return.</p>

        <p>This means that suppose investors exploit all the information \(\Phi_t\) and then form an investment strategy
          then investors will always go for a best trading strategy. The strategy that yields less amount of money will
          be discarded in any case. </p>


      </div>




      <h3><strong>\(\mathrm{II.}\) The Random Walk Model </strong></h3>
      <p>It says that the the price of the security in successive periods are independently and identically
        distributed. </p>


      <strong>How should the distribution be in this case?</strong>
      <p> The conditional and marginal probability distribution of the piece of the security is the same that is
        \(F(\tilde{r}_{j,t+1} | \Phi_t) = f(\tilde{r}_{j,t+1})\). The density function is same at all t. </p>

      <div class="bg-sweetyellow pad givemarginx justify">



        <li>Past is inconsequential. The application here is if there is any information is available the investors will
          act upon them and information will become irrelevant.</li>

        <li>Hence the current return becomes the best guess for assessing the future return.</li>

      </div>




      <h3><strong>Assumptions for Market Efficiency</strong></h3>

      <ol>
        <li>There are no transaction costs.
          <ul>
            <li>However this is sufficient as long as the transaction costs represent all the available information.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Every investor should have access to all the information.</li>

        <li>There shouldn't be disagreements among investors.
          <ul>
            <li>This does not mean that everyone is consistently forever a winner or forever a loser. Investors who lose
              money learn from their mistakes and for investors who gain, it is not that they always will be successful.
            </li>
            <li>Even if there are disagreements it does not mean that markets won't be efficient as long as there are
              large number of investors.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <P>Note that all the three above sufficient conditions are unlikely to hold in the real world.</P>

      <p>
        A weaker but more sensible definition of market efficiency is that prices reflect the available information to
        the point that the marginal benefit of the new information shouldn't exceed the marginal cost of obtaining that
        information.</p>




      <hr>
      <h5>Reiterating that, prices look at adjustment in response to three information subsets:</h5>
      <p></p>

      


      <h3><strong>Joint Hypothesis Problem with Market Efficiency</strong></h3>
      <p>Market Efficiency per se is not testable. It has to be tested with some other model of equilibrium such as
        asset pricing model. </p>
      <div class="bg-sweetyellow pad givemarginx">
        <p>
          Before we say if the asset prices properly reflect the available information, we need to look into how prices
          are formed and ho the word 'properly' is defined.</p>
        <p>So pricing model plays a very important role in determining market efficiency.</p>

      </div>

      <h4>Behaviorists perspective of Pricing models</h4>
      <p> Behaviorists usually disagree on many simplifying assumptions on pricing models hence market efficiency hypothesis becomes irrelevant. (Read more on this from book.)</p>


      <h4><strong>Weak form tests: </strong></h4>
      <p>
      Historical information. If prices changes are limited to past behavior of prices.</
      </p>
      <h5>Testing procedures:</h5>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Historical sequence of prices</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Price Changes</strong></li>
        <li>Volume Information: We have only talked about prices not about quantity. Hence volume traded becomes very important.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Tests for independence: </strong>If the returns are dependent upon something then that information can be exploited to make profits.</li>
        <li><strong>Trading rules: </strong>A trading strategy that will always generate profit is filtered out.</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="bg-lightgrey pad givemarginx">
      <h4>Short Selling:</h4>  
      <p>Short selling occurs when an investor borrows a security and sells it on the open market, planning to buy it back later for less money. </p>
      <p>If I borrow Rs 100 and sell a security in open market. After 1 year I buy back the security for Rs. 80. I made a profit of Rs. 20 from drop in security price.</p>
      </div>

      <p>A general conclusion is that weak form market efficiency hypothesis is generally upheld.</p>

      <div class="bg-lightgrey pad givemarginx">
        <h4>Event studies:</h4>
        <p>Studying price movements around an important announcement and examining the potential of above/below average profit if investor acted upon when information was made public. </p>  
        <p>Event studies give a clear picture of the speed of adjustment of prices.</p> 
       </div>

       <h3><strong>Sharp-Lintner-Black Model and tests for efficiency</strong></h3>
       <p>Sharp-Lintner-Black Model is used to predict market \(\beta\). </p>
       <div class="bg-lightgrey pad givemarginx"><h4>What are \(\beta\)s?</h4>
   
       <p>\(\beta\)s are the measurement of the volatility of the stock in relation to the market. The definition of market is a combined index such as SENSEX or NIFTY which gives an overall trend of market. Therefore the stocks which are used to calculate SENSEX and NIFTY have a \(\beta\) of 1.0. A \(\beta\) more than 1.0 implies that the stock is more volatile than the market.</p>

       </div>
       
       <p>There are variables other than \(\beta\) such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Whether the firm is large or small:  Controlling for \(\beta\)s, It is found that small firms have a higher expected returns.</li>
        <li>Leverage Ratio: Controlling for \(\beta\)s, leverage is found to be positively related with expected returns.</li>
      </ul>   
      </p>

      <p>These stated above are actually anomalies for SLB model because of the other variables that are effecting market returns and hence \(\beta\)s are faulty.</p>

      <div class="bg-sweetyellow pad givemarginx">Eugene Fama comes out very strongly in favour of efficiency. Asset pricing models from which these \(\beta\)s are derived are modelled conditional on efficiency. 
        
        <p></p>If these anomalies wither away because they are acted upon by investors then the market efficiency hypothesis is reasserted that is market inefficiency has been erased when its knowledge became public.</p> </div>
