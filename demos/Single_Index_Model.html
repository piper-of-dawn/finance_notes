     <p>
      The return on a stock can be written as:
      $$ R_i = a_i + \beta_i.R_m $$
      where:
      <ul>
        <li>
      \(a_i\) is the component of security i’s return that is independent of the market’s
      performance — a random variable.
      <li>
      \(R_m\)s the rate of return on the market index — a random variable.
      <li>
      \(\beta_i\) is a constant that measures the expected change in \(R_i\) given a change in \(R_m\).
      <li>
        \(\sigma_m \) denote the standard deviation of \(R_m\). 
       <li>
        \(\sigma_{ei} \) denote the standard deviation of \(i_{th}\) security.

    </ul>

        <div class="bg-sweetyellow pad givemarginx"><h4>Interpretation of \(\beta\)</h4>
     <p>\(\beta\) represents the sensitivity of the returns to a stock to market movements. If \(\beta\) is greater than 1 then stock is more sensitive to the market and if the \(\beta\) is less than 1, the stock is less sensitive to the market.
      <h6>Why 1?</h6>   
      Regress the portfolio to itself and you will get \(\beta\) = 1
    </p>
        
        </div>
      
   
   <p>
    Let us break \(a_i\) into the intercept \(\alpha_i\) and the random component \(e_i\). \(a_i = \alpha_i + e_i\).
    Now the return on a stock can be written as:
      $$ R_i = \alpha_i + \beta_i.R_m + e_i$$
      <h5>Expected Return of an individual security</h5>      
      $$ E(R_i) = E(\alpha_i) + E(\beta_i.R_m) + E(e_i) $$
      <h5>Risk of an individual security</h5>  
      $$ Var(R_i) = Var(\alpha_i) + Var(\beta_i.R_m) + Var(e_i) $$
      $$ \Rightarrow \sigma_i^2 = \beta_i^2 \sigma_m^2 + \sigma_ei^2 $$


     </p> 
   </div>


   
   
   
   
   <!--- Subsection !-->
   <h3><strong>Risk of the Portfolio</strong></h3>
    <p>Define \(\beta_p\) as the weighted average of \(\beta_i\)s, i.e. \(\beta_p = \sum \beta_i X_i \). </p>
    <p>Define \(\alpha_p\) as the weighted average of \(\alpha_i\)s, i.e. \(\alpha_p = \sum \alpha_i X_i \). </p>
    <p>$$ R_p^* = \alpha_p + \beta_p.R_m^* $$</p>









<!--- Subsection !-->
    <h3><strong>Diversification</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Risk of the portfolio \(\sigma_p\)^2 is:
        $$ \sigma_p^2 = \beta_p^2 \sigma_m^2 + \sum_{i}^{N} X_i^2 \sigma_{ei}^2 $$
        Let \(X_i\) be \(1 \over N\), means we allocate equal amount of money to each portfolio.
        $$\Rightarrow \sigma_p^2 = \beta_p^2 \sigma_m^2 + {1 \over N} \sum_{i}^{N} {1 \over N}  \sigma_{ei}^2 $$
        Now as \(N \to \infty\) \(\Rightarrow\) \(\sigma_{ei}^2 \to 0\). 

        <div class="bg-sweetyellow pad givemarginx">
          <p>
            The implication being as the size of portfolio increases the average residual risk decreases. This is known as diversification. The risk that cannot be diversified is the first term: \(\beta_p^2 \sigma_m^2\). </p>
        </div>

        Hence, \(\sigma_p = \sum \beta_i X_i \sigma_m\). Note that  \(\sigma_m \) denotes the standard deviation of \(R_m\), and hence is a given parameter regardless of the security we examine.

        <div class="bg-lightgrey pad givemarginx"></div>
        <p> Therefore, \(\sigma_ei\) is known as diversifiable risk and \(\sigma_m\) is known as non-diversifiable risk.
      </p>









      <!--- Subsection !-->
      <h3><strong>Price of Risk</strong></h3>
      <p>We have seen that the capital market line is given by \(R_p = {{(R_a - R_f)} \over \sigma_a}. \sigma_p + R_f \).
      </p>
      <div class="bg-sweetyellow pad givemarginx"><p> Risk free rate \(R_f\) is the price of time.</p> </div>
      <p>Note that here \({R_a - R_f} \over  {\sigma_a}\) represents the price of risk.The interpretation is that it represents the marginal returns that portfolio will pay when risk is increased.</p>
      <p>If we are anywhere on the capital market line we are combining the risk-free asset and the portfolio in a particular combination.</p>
    
        <p>Any portfolio above the capital market line will either have a higher return at a same/lower risk. Hence investors will short the portfolio lying on CML for that portfolio.</p>

        <p>Thus arbitrage will ensure that all the investments and the portfolios lie on CML.</p>

       <p>We know,
        $$ R_f = a $$
        $$ R_a = R_f + b $$
        $$ \Rightarrow R_i = R_f + \beta_i (R_a - R_f)$$


       </p>
