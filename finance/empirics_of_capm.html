                <p>One of the greatest insights that comes from this equation is that it states what is unimportant in determining return. Beta is the index of systematic risk. The equation validates the conclusion that systematic risk is the only important
                    variable.

                <p>
                    CAPM is still widely used in applications such as estimating cost of capital performs and evaluating the performance of management so. So both in terms of investors where you are going to try and evaluate portfolios and in terms of your corporate finance
                    where we are interested in figuring out what is the cost of capital, the capital is very very import.</p>

                <p>Cost of the capital is the price of risk.</p>
            </div>

<div id = "CCAPM" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">
    <h3>Consumption based CAPM</h3>
                <p> The attraction of the model is that it offers a powerful and intuitively pleasing predictions of how to measure risk and the relationship between expected return and risk but the empirical record of the market of the model is really very
                    poor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    CAPM says that the risk of a stock should be measured relative to a comprehensive market portfolio that in principle can improve not just traded financial assets which we have been talking, <mark>but also consumer durables, real estate and human capital.</mark>                    Reason is your house, your car is after all something that is giving you a return,in form of utility returns on your human capital so. So this may not be financial assets. These may or may not be traded, but of course there is a second
                    hand value for your car. You can always sell your real estate . And you're already renting out your human capital. So in principle all these other investments also have a risk attached to it.
                </p>

                    <h4><strong>Consumption based CAPM or CCPAM</strong></h4>

                    <p>The consumption capital asset pricing model (CCAPM) is an extension of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) that uses a consumption beta instead of a market beta to explain expected return premiums over the risk-free rate. While
                        the CAPM formula relies on the market portfolio's return to predict future asset prices, the CCAPM relies on aggregate consumption.</p>

                So Fama and French have flagged these factors that is,
                <ul>
                    <li>On principle the efficient frontier must have not only financial assets, but possibly all assets. </li>
                    <li>Most of the empirical works only consider domestic stocks not the foriegn stocks.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>So in a way, Fama and French hint at a sampling bias in CAPM.

                    So in Markovitz Model, is this framework that is our risk return story. And investors select portfolio at time \(t-1\) that produces a stochastic return at time \(t\). For deriving CAPM, two key assumptions were made:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Complete Agreement: Given the market clearing asset prices at \(t-1\), investors agree on the joint distribution of returns from \(t-1\) to \(t\). </li>
                        <li>Borrowing and lending at a risk free rate.</li>

                <p> That is, if you have 10 stocks. Then those stocks must be weighted by the market value and hence called value weightt portfolio. If I have ₹10,000, how am I going to allocate my ₹10,000 across? What I'm going
                    to do is I'm going to add the market value of all these 10 stocks. And that stock which contributes most to my total market value will get the higher weight. This is exactly what is done to calculate SENSEX or NIFTY50.

                <p>Such a risky asset is this class in the market portfolio in the sense that it contributes nothing to the variation of the market. And now if you can. OK, if you can find such an asset, that will be the completion of this argument, and
                    it is very simple to figure out what that asset is going to be. When there is risk free lending and borrowing the expected return on assets that are uncorrelated with the market return must equal the risk free rate. </p>

                <p>CAPM is based on many restrictive assumptions that do not hold true in real world. Hence it needs to be tested against the real data.</p>

                <p>Hence the test for the CAPM model is based on the following three assumptions:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The expected returns on all assets are linearly related to their bettas and no other variable as marginal explanatory power.
                            <indent>
                                This is what the model obviously implies. The CAPM theory does not allow any other explanatory variable except \(beta\).
                            </indent>
                        </li>
                        <li>Beta premium is positive.</li>

                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Most of the empirical tests of the CAPM model either use the cross section or the time-series regressions.</p>

                    Independent varibales are \(beta\)s. this means that error terms must contain no information. there is no correlation between any lags. Fama and Macbeth find this to be true. the early test results show poor performance of CAPM. there is positive relationship
                    between \(beta\) and \(E(R_i)\) but it is very flat. The coeficcient on beta is less than average excess market return.

                    Some agents are not fully rational. - They reject the efficient market story. Because they question the basis of efficient market hypothesis that is rationality. The behavioral finance has two building blocks:
