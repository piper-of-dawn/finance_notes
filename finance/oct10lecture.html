 Independent varibales are \(beta\)s. this means that error terms must contain no information. there is no correlation between any lags. Fama and Macbeth find this to be true. the early test results show poor performance of CAPM. there is positive relationship
between \(beta\) and \(E(R_i)\) but it is very flat. The coeficcient on beta is less than average excess market return.

$$ R_{it} - R_{ft} = \alpha_{i} + \beta_{iM} (R_{Mt} - R_{ft}) + \epsilon_{it} $$ The set of assets does not include all marketeable assets.

Real problem: When \(\beta\) is the not the only variable explaining returns. This challenges the existance of \(beta\)s. Basu (1977) asks \(Price \over Earnings\) is related to performance of common stocks.

Earning capitalization rate (E/P) is low, then either currently traded price of share is high or expected earnings is low. If the E/P is low, either price is low or expected profits is high. Cite, Efficient Market Hypothesis. Size, Earnings price, debt
equity and book to market ratios add to the explanation of expected stock returns provided by market beta. \\\\\\\\\\\\\Behaviorists approach\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\Overreaction - high return to value stocks and low return to growth stocks.\\\\\\\\\\
