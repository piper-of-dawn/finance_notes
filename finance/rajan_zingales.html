                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Rajan and Zingales remark that a very little is known about the empirical relevance of theories.
                        This is to say that there exist no empirical template grounded in first principles that could
                        explain the theory. For example: In a MM world, leverage is not systematically related to any
                        firm characteristic. <quote>Leverage is an outcome of accident, history or co-incidence in the
                            Modigliani Miller world.</quote>

                    <p>Uses data on G7 countries on non-financial firms and non-service sector firms. </p>

                        <h4 class="aligncenter"><strong>What are non financial firms?</strong></h4>

                        <p>Any firm that is not into serious business of lending or borrowing, that is they are not
                            financial intermediaries. It is very difficult to seperate financial from non-financial
                            firms.</p>

                    </div>


                    <div class="bg-note pad givemarginx" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
                        <h4>Why we are not including financial firms?</h4>
                        <p> Financial firms are by-definition always levered.Think of a bank that accepts deposits and
                            gives out loans. Deposits are a kind of borrowing of a Bank from its customers. Hence a
                            financial firm is always levered. </p>
                    </div>



                    <div class="bg-note pad givemarginx" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
                        <h4>Why we are not including service sector firms?</h4>
                        <p>Service sector firms usually do not require of very large fixed investment to begin unlike
                            manufacturing firms which are dependent upon borrowing to fund the production. Service
                            sector firms are more of human capital centric and since we do not have a theory that
                            explains human capital hence we have decided to exclude the service sector firms.</p>
                    </div>


                    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="500">The major takeaway here is that we do not have a
                        theory of everything. No unified theory can
                        explain the capital structure of firms and hence we have separate our sample into service /
                        manufacturing firms, financial / non-financial firms etc.</p>

                <div id="Measurement of Leverage" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">

                    <h2>Measurement of Leverage</h2>
                    <p> One of the most remarkable explanations given by Rajan and Zingales is that they have very
                        eloquently argued that which accounting measure of leverage one should use in the study is not a
                        trivial question.</p>

                    <p>Leverage is nothing but stock of debt divided by the market value of firms. The broadest measure
                        of leverage is total liabilities divided total assets.</p>

                    <div id="Agency cost approach">
                        <h3>Agency cost approach</h3>
                        <p>This is manager-owner approach to view a from that is managers are different from owners.
                            Hence it is suggested that the stock of debt should be divided by value of the firm to
                            calculate leverage. This gives what is left over after for shareholders.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="Bankruptcy cost approach">
                        <h3>Bankruptcy cost approach</h3>
                        <p> If the firm goes bankrupt then the ownership of the firm is transferred to the bondholders.
                            This approach is that whether the firm then can meet its fixed payments along with
                            bankruptcy cost. Hence the measure of interest coverage ratio becomes relevant</p>
                    </div>


                    <p> The takeaway here is the measurement metric is dependent on what you are trying to emphasize in
                        the study. That is, if you want to emphasize bankruptcy costs then you should go with interest
                        coverage ratio.</p>

                    <div id="Problem with Total Liabilities / Total Assets">
                        <h3>Problem with Total Liabilities / Total Assets</h3>
                        <p>If we define leverage as total liabilities / total assets then we run into following
                            practical problems:
                            <li>There is no indication of whether the firm will default in future.</li>
                            <li>Total liabilities might include very short term liabilities (transaction purpose) such
                                as accounts payable which might over state leverage. The accounts payable are mere
                                postponement of payments not a medium to finance investment hence it should not be
                                include for the calculation of leverage.<strong>Here, we are arguing that the duration
                                    of the debt is important.</strong></li>
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Hence a more careful measure of leverage is required. Studies usually use:
                        $$ \text{Leverage} = {\text{Debt(Both short term and long term)} \over \text{Total Assets}} $$
                    <p>This measure reflects the agency cost approach.</p>
                    $$ \text{Coverage Ratio} = {\text{EBIT} \over \text{Interest Expenses}} $$
                    <p>EBIT is the earning before interest and taxes. Coverage ratio measures the risk that equity
                        holders will not be able to pay the fixed payments of the firm and hence would have to give up
                        control. This measure reflects the bankruptcy cost approach.</p>
                    
                    <div id= "Problems that still remain">
                        <h3>Problems that still remain</h3>
                        <p>However, in both the measures of leverage the problem of short term debts that just mean
                            postponement of payments still remains.</p>
                        <p>Ability of a firm to make fixed payments, at very low levels of debt is different from the
                            firm which is at a very high level of debt.
                        </p>
                        <p>This measure is very sensitive to income fluctuations because both numerator and denominators
                            have very sensitive to variables.
                        </p>
                    </div>


                </div>


                <div id="Findings of the paper" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">

                    <h2>Findings of the paper</h2>

                    <div id="Tax Story">
                        <h3>Tax story</h3>

                        <p> Before getting into anything we have to state some remarkable findings from Rajan and
                            Zingales paper that US and Japan are very diverse countries in terms of their bank
                            orientation but they have very similar leverages. Similarly United States and United Kingdom
                            are very similar countries in terms of bank orientation they have very different leverages
                        </p>

                        <p>Hence we should depart from bank oriented explanations and focus on an institutions oriented
                            study,</p>

                        <p>The focus should be shifted onto tax codes, bankruptcy laws and bond market infrastructure to
                            explain the capital structures.</p>

                        <p>Tax stories are complicated. how operating profits are channeled to investors matters a lot
                            in debt and equity decisions. It is quite possible that tax rates influence the aggregate
                            leverage in the country. Rajan and Zingales find that this holds true for the high tax rates
                            but not for the lower level of taxes.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="Bankruptcy Story">
                        <h3>Bankruptcy story</h3>

                        <p>The contrast between United States and Germany is noteworthy here, laws in United States are
                            very firm (debtor) friendly whereas in Germany they are very creditor friendly. So one can
                            expect that a firm in United States that usually should not go bankrupt might go bankrupt.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In United States, the priority is given to the continuity of firms where as in United
                            Kingdom, the priority is given to the interests of the creditors.
                        </p>

                </div>

                    <h2>What doesn't matter?</h2>

                    <div id="Bank Orientation and Market Orientation">
                        <h3>Bank Orientation and Market Orientation</h3>

                        <p> Germany is a very bank oriented economy that is the banks are allowed to lend as well as
                            hold equities in the firms whereas in United States there is a restriction on both the
                            activities.</p>


                        <p>

                            Rajan and Zingales conclude that the distinction between market oriented economies and Bank
                            oriented economies is very clear in the type of financing that is used. Bank oriented
                            economies go for more of a private financing (which cannot be traded) such as bank loans.
                            such as which cannot be traded in the stock market, whereas Market oriented economies go for
                            more of a public financing (bond markets) which can be publically traded.

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            However note that this is not useful in explaining leverage. Debt is debt no matter if it is
                            publicly traded or not publicly traded.
                        </p>

                            <h3>Threat of takeover</h3>
                            <p> In United States United Kingdom and Canada the threat of takeover is very credible
                                because of the diffused ownership structure. In Japan and Continental Europe the
                                ownership structure is highly concentrated. Rajan and Zingales find that ownership or
                                manager-owner dynamics do not impact leverage because both the opposite forces are at
                                play here:</p>
                            <ol>

                                <li> When shareholders are in board of directors that is active part of management, then
                                    they will facilitate equity issues.</li>
                                <li>

                                    On the other hand if shareholders are banks, then they will be against private
                                    financing and will force their clients to borrow.
                                </li>

                        <p>Rajan and Zingales distil down to these four factors to explain leverage: </p>

                            <li>Firm Size: Leverage is expected to be positively correlated with firm size as large
