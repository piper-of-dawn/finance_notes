<h4 class="aligncenter"><strong>Shareholder's Discount Rate</strong></h4>
<p>
It is the valuation of future stream of dividends to shareholder's. It depends both on risk and return. It depends upon:
<li>Variability of Dividends</li>
<li>Gearing Ratio</li>
</p>-->



<div id="Assumptions" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">
    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
    <p>We introduce the following assumptions into the model:
        <ol>
            <li>Progressive Income tax</li>
            <li>Flat rate of Company profits tax</li>
            <li>Flat rate of Capital Gains tax</li>
            <li>Interest deductibility of corporate tax</li>
            <li>No inflation allowances</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
</div>
<!--
<h2>What do taxes do?</h2>
<p>Taxes drive a wedge between \(\delta\), the share holders required rate of return and \(y_c\), the gross earnings on equity and the return to an investor in a company with gross yield \(y_e\) is:

    $$Y(1-t_c)=[1-(t_g \ r + (1-r)t_p]$$
    <li>\(t_x\): Effective tax rate</li>
    <li>Here capital gains tax is \(t_g\) which is charged on retained earnings and dividends tax is \(t_p\).</li>
<p>Here capital gains tax is \(t_g\) and dividends tax is \(t_p\).</p>
</p>-->
<div id = "Choice between debt and equity" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">
         
    <p>Debt is preferred over equity as a source of finance because:</p>
    <p><strong>Firms have this advantage that interest paid on debt is tax deductible plus shareholders have to pay dividends and capital gains tax.</strong></p>
    
    
    
    <p>Miller in 1979 criticized the tax bankruptcy model on the following two grounds:
        <li>Actual bankruptcy costs on publicly quoted companies were very small in relation to the tax advantage of debt.</li>
        <li>There was almost no change in debt-equity ratios in the USA between 1920 and 1950s despite taxes increasing over five times.</li>
    </p>
    
    <p>Therefore there is no tax bankruptcy tradeoff.</p>
</div>

<div id = "Miller Equilibrium Model" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">
    <h2>Miller Equilibrium Model</h2>
    <p>What Miller does is that he compared the income of an investor of a geared firm and non geared firm.</p>
    <p>In equilibrium, both should be equal otherwise investors would only invest in a firm which gives them higher earning.</p>
    <!--
    <p>
    Let \(Y_1\) and \(Y_2\) represent the earnings of a geared firm 1 and non geared firm 2 respectively.
    
    <p>Earnings from a geared firm 1:
    
        $$Y = a(\Pi - i \ D_1)(1-t_c)(1-t_x)$$ 
        Here, \(t_x= (t_g \ r + (1-r)t_p\) where \(t_x\) represents effective tax rate (accounting for both retained earnings and dividends).
    </p>-->
    
    <p>Algebra skipped</p>
    
    <div id="Gains from Gearing">
    <h2>Gains from Gearing</h2>
    $$G = M_1 + D_1 - M_2$$
    <p>This is the difference between shareholder earnings from a geared and non geared firm.</p>
    $$G \ = \ M_1 + D_1 - M_2 \ = \ D_1{{1-(t_c)(1-t_x)} \over {1-t_p}} $$
    <li>Gains of gearing is given by \((1-t_c)(1-t_x)\) is equal to \(1-t_p\) the tax advantages of gearing are small or negligible. This might serve as an explanation why gearing ratios in US changed a little when taxes changed a lot.</li>
    <li>Gains of gearing is given by \((1-t_c)(1-t_x)\) is greater than \(1-t_p\) the there exist tax advantages of gearing and non geared firm will gear up.</li>
    <li>In equilibrium, \((1-t_c)(1-t_x) = (1-t_p\). Any firm changing its gearing might attract different clientele of investors but the gains from gearing do not persist.</li>
    </div>

    <div id="Tax based Clientele" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">
        
        <div class="bg-note pad givemarginx" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000"><h4>Tax based Clientele</h4>
        <p> One of the most important insights from Miller equilibrium is that companies are interested in the personal income taxes faced by its shareholders. </p>
        <p>A rich investor who faces a high marginal income tax rate and will have the biggest incentive to engage in gearing that is he will borrow and invest in an ungeared company which has no debt associated tax savings. This will make him obtain a tax saving on his personal borrowing. </p>
        <p>Whereas a poor investor will prefer geared firm.</p>
        <p>This will make distribution bi-modal. That is you will have clustering with very low gearing or you might have a clustering with a very high gearing.</p>
