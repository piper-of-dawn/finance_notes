  <h3><strong>Sources of data</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>National flow of funds statements: </strong> These are records of the flow of funds between different
      sectors of the household.</li>
    <li><strong>Company Accounts: </strong> The second source is company accounts but the sample size is small in this
      case.</li>

  <h3><strong>Observations from flow of funds data on net average financing of Non-finance enterprises</strong></h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Retention is the chief source of financing.</li>
    <li>There are some marked variations in self-financing ratios across countries. In the United Kingdom and the United
      States, more than three-quarters of investment is funded from retentions. In Finland, France, Japan, and Italy,
      appreciably more is raised externally</li>
    <li>In no country do companies raise a substantial amount of finance from securities markets.</li>
    <li>  Summing together short-term securities, bonds, and shares reveals that the largest amount raised in securities markets is 19% in Canada on a gross basis (i.e., as a proportion of total sources) and 13% on a net basis in the United States.</li>
    <li>Banks are the dominant source of finance almost in all nations.</li>
    <li>Bank finance is particularly more pronounced in France, Italy and Japan</li>
    <li>U.K. investment has been consistently financed from retentions (91% on average). Bank finance has contributed close to zero (3% on average) on a net basis.</li>
    <li>There is a strong inverse relation between the proportion of expenditure financed from retentions and bank credit.</li>
    <li>Securities markets have declined in significance as sources of finance for British industry. Trade credit increased in importance at
      the end of the 1960s and early 1970s.</li>
    <li>Small- and medium-sized firms are considerably more reliant on external finance than large firms. A smaller proportion of small- than large-company finance comes from securities markets.</li>
    <li>Bank (and short-term) finance account for approximately two-thirds of U.K. companies' total debt but more than five-sixth of small companies' total debt.</li>

  </ol>
  
<div class="bg-sweetyellow pad givemarginx">   <h5><strong>Why banks exist?</strong></h5> <p>
  Prima facie, banking systems would be expected to avoid some of the information deficiencies associated with securities markets. A primary rationale for the existence of banks is that they perform screening and monitoring functions that individual investors can only undertake at high cost. </p></div>

<h3><strong> How this paper performs with existing theories that explain corporate finance?</strong></h3>

 

  <h4>Irrelevance</h4>
  
  <h5>Modilgliani_Miller proposition</h5>

  <p>
  The most widely cited theory of corporate finance is the Modigliani and Miller proposition. This states that in the presence of perfect and complete
  capital markets and in the absence of taxation, corporate valuations, and costs  of capital are independent of firms' capital structures. At face value, this proposition suggests no underlying determinant of corporate capital structure: the financing of industry an accident of history and a product of random influences. However, the stability of financing patterns over time and countries that has been noted above argues strongly against the thesis of indifference.</p>

<h4>Transaction costs</h4>
<p>
  UK and USA have the most developed financial systems yet the demand for the external finance is very low. When equity markets are observed, a lot less number of companies are quoted on France and Germany equity markets than Japan and UK. But they raise the same amount of funds from equity markets as Japan and UK. Hence, issues such as transaction costs and access to security markets does not have any empirical relevance in these examples.
  </p>

  <h4>Taxation</h4>
  <p>
  The first point to note about taxation is that in virtually every country of this study (with the possible exception of Finland, debt finance has been favored over equity. There is a poor relation between tax incentives to employ different forms of finance and actual financing proportions, that is tax incentive does not translate into action. For example: Germany, which has the highest incentive to use debt in relation to retentions and the second lowest use of debt relative to retentions. - The United Kingdom has the lowest debt-to-retentions ratio and the third highest tax incentive.  However it should be noted that, there are a lot of issue associated with cross- country comparisons and they may not be accurate every time.
</p>

<h4>Information theories</h4>

<p>
  At first sight, information theories appear to be quite consistent with many of the results reported in this paper. For  example, Myers's (1984) peckingorder hypothesis suggests that riskless securities (debt) are used in preference to risky (new equity) and retentions are used in preference to external sources of finance (observations 1 and 3).</p>

<div class="bg-sweetyellow pad givemarginx"><p>
  However, if anything, this relation between bond finance and ratings raises something of a puzzle. If it is possible to establish institutions that perform a pure information-gathering exercise, then what is the role of banks? Information theory cannot explain why there is a clear preference for bank finance in most countries and why bank finance remains important in the United States.</p>
</div>
<p>

  Information deficiencies do not provide a convincing explanation for observed international patterns of corporate finance on their own. There is an aspect of the relation between institutions and firms that information theories fail to capture. The next subsection suggests that this has to do with control rather than monitoring of firms.</p>

  <h4>Control Theories</h4>
<p>
The decision to finance depends on how easily the creditor can take control of the business. It is all based on creditor becoming entrepreneur.
<h6>Predictions</h6>
<ol>
<li>Gearing levels will be high where the value of assets under creditor management is high. This means that if  firm has high gearing that is high debt to equity ratio, then creditor has greater control over the assets.</li>
<li>If asset is not currently employed in production then creditor can take control of it easily.</li>
<li>If it is difficult for the creditor to take ownership then external finance will be little.</li>

</ol>

<h3><strong>Why does most finances come from banks?</strong></h3>

<p>


  A quite striking observation to emerge from the empirical analysis is that in no country do securities market contribute a large proportion of corporate sector financing. In some countries, the average net contribution was close to or less than zero. Equity markets are particularly deficient in this respect. That is not to say that equity markets do not perform an important function. They may promote allocative efficiency by providing prices that guide the allocation of resources or productive efficiency through reallocating existing resources via, for example, the takeover process. But in terms of aggregate corporate sector funding, their function appears limited. Instead, a majority of external finance comes from banks.

 <h6> Why?
   
 </h6>
 <p>
  Neither transaction costs nor taxation were found to provide adequate descriptions of corporate financing patterns in different countries. One interpretation for the preponderance of bank finance is that financial intermediaries perform a central function in diminishing one of the most serious deficiencies of financial markets: asymmetries in information. According to this view, banks play an important role in collecting and processing information that markets are unable to do or can do only at high cost.
