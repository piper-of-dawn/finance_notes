 Going by this, individual stocks and imprecise because is a problem. So let's do one thing. Let us work with portfolios rather than individual securities. Since I expected returns on portfolios on market beta combined in the same way in portfolios, right?
Give give, give him explain security entrances. Also explain portfolio returns. So remember when we were thinking about the efficient. Frontier. There we said this is efficient frontier contains both individual, that is, that is portfolios with just one
security and portfolios with many securities as well. OK portfolios with one security is that stock. OK, so there was nothing in our theory which said that only stocks are there. There are portfolios there as well. And great advantage with portfolios
that you will immediately see that estimating that our for a portfolio your estimates are going to be much better. Why is that Kelly anybody answer this? Why do you think the estimate of better for a portfolio is going to be much better than the estimate
of better for a singles? No answer why. Why do you think that is going to be the case? Is it, uh, in short, and the risk is diversified in portfolio? It's not got shorter, and we're now runs here. Yeah, OK. Ah yes, in sound portfolio you see you can have
banned portfolios as well. No, just because you have a portfolio, it does not mean that the risk is less. But that will be dominated, isn't it? On their vision on the efficient frontier, you will only have those portfolios which have the minimum risk
for that return, right? Or you can look at it the other way round. For AAA given risk class you will have the. That point will represent the best return that you can get for that risk class. All that is said that is fine. OK. So obviously. Be cause your
risk is going to be reduced. The precise neus with which you are going to be able to estimate the better is going to rise now. You see the point? OK, OK. Is that yeah? For an individual stock. The radiation may be very large, right? So you cannot start
thinking in terms of simple sampling also. OK you, you're only things that you will do on an individual stock will have a lot of. Sampling errors. Whatever I'm bringing that his down in a portfolio. Oh my estimate of better is going to be much better.
OK, because the variance of returns would have reduced quite dramatically. Hopefully quite dramatically. But on the front yard, I'm confident that this is the minimum. OK, OK so my estimates are better, are going to be better. OK, so estimates are better.
Diversified portfolios are more precise than estimates for individual securities, thus reducing errors in variables problems. OK, OK so. So instead of estimating this year PM with individual security. OK, these guys suggested. Let's estimate this by using
portfolios itself. Now, then the problem arises. How are you going to construct these portfolios? OK, so the grouping however shrinks the range of the retailers and reduces the statistical power. Researchers sarge securities on better as well forming
portfolios. The first portfolio contains securities with the lowest betters, and so on up to the last portfolio with the highest better. This sorting is now standard in empirical test. What do they do? So suppose I have 1000 pounds. Correct? And I have
a market portfolio, whatever. Nifty 50. Isn't the 500, whatever it is? So I can use individual returns and returns on the market portfolio and get a better. For each security. OK. Then what I do is I rank these securities. From top to bottom. And then
I start saying now I'm constructing portfolios of lobata slightly higher, slightly higher, slightly so out of this entire range of 1000 firms. Which I have kind of. Started by beta. OK I can decide on a size of the portfolio thirty 4050, whatever it is.
And then based on the better, I can construct these portfolios. You see what is done. I have a market return. I have the return on an individual. Ah. Sure. Through the market return and return on the individual share, I can estimate the better. I can
rank these bettors top to bottom, and then I can construct a portfolio of firms with battles. In the sense top 13 X 13 X 13. And so on and so forth. OK, so if I have 1000 farms and I say 30 so you can figure out how many. I can get. Is that is that clear
what we're saying? Yes. Any confusion here? No, said no. So we're starting with individual firms individual shares, and I observe a market return that is of a market portfolio. Are you using these two returns? I get into beta for each firm. OK, and I
rank these beetles and construct my portfolios based on the weekend. No. So now we're going to an old. In Macbeth 1973. OK. They use data from January 1926 to 1960. So how many years? You can imagine the computers. Capacity available in those days. K
now what is this will be considered to be not such a large sample, but in 1973, where computational fact facilities were really ancient. K Anne, you can see that this is a massive massive sample. OK, and they propose a method for addressing the inference
problem caused by correlation of residuals in cross section. But So you know, in our original model we did not allow. We said that the residuals are going to be very wonderful there obviously not. Will be running wireless regressions and. If your residuals
are not well behaved, you're going to be in trip trouble. OK, so so let's go ahead step by step to figure out what these guys. How these people came over these problems OK? So instead of estimating a single cross section ration of monthly average return
on betas, estimate month by month cross section regressions on monthly returns on minus. No. How do they do this? So the time series or monthly slopes and intercepts along the standard errors of means are then used to test whether average premium for
better is positive and whether the average return on assets are uncorrelated with the market is equal to the risk free rate. So then. What do I do? I I do this for some time? OKOK The time series of monthly slope. So for each month I will have a slope,
right? Because we are considering monthly returns. OK, OK. And I will have intercepts as well. OK, along with the standard letters of the mean. So as soon as I get an intercept it will have a standard error. OK. OK. And then I. Test whether the average
premium or better is positive and whether the average return on assets are UN correlated to the market is equal to the disk. So whether that. Constant equals, the rest. Are you understanding what is being done? Because I can run this these regressions
for every month, right? Because monthly returns. OK, I have monthly return for the stock. I have monthly return for the portfolio. Right when I do this regression, I get a constant and I get a. So right now I have to see weather, weather, weather this
this this works. For the standard average intercept and slope by the month to month variation in regression coefficients, which fully captures the effects of residual correlation on variational degradation. But science turn the problem of actually estimating
the point. Looking at me. The scopes. I'm saying that I I need not really start bothering about whether my error term is is is well behaved I'm I'm just trying to sidestep the issue. OK, because I'm not running one regression, I'm running a regression
every month. OK, No. Operationally. Operationally, they form 20 portfolios of securities to estimate betters, that is, and then now calculating the portfolios of these better is not of the security, so. So our IP. OK, mine is RFP is equal to A1 plus better
I into our empty minus RFT plus the error term. So this is what they are. Estimate OK. No, they then estimate one regression for each month over the time period, 35 to 68. That is 7 years of data are used to form portfolios. The next five years are used
to form values of the independent variables. OKOK and then this and return our fit month by month for the remaining 4 here. So. So what do I do in the sample first I have to for my portfolios, correct? So first I found my portfolios. Then using those
portfolios. OKOK seven years of data are used to form portfolios. The next five years I used to form the initial values of the independent variable. So the next five years I'm going to get what? What are the independent variables? My return on the portfolio,
right? And the better of the portfolio, right? OK, OK for the next five years I will. I will generate these these better and then risk reward on our fit month by one for the remaining. Using this then I I try and figure out my risk and return for the
remaining phone. The last four years for which I have data, but I'm not using the data now I'm using my. PayPal in the sense that what I have done I have found my portfolios. OK, OK and I have my initial values of the independent variables, then the risk
and return of it month by month for the remaining. That If if I do this in this way, then I have a very clean method of trying to figure out the following things where RIT is the return on the portfolio. OK, OK. No. RIP is equal to find naughty. 51 better
1 + 5 two better to square. Remember this better and better and better are the independent variables which I have. I have bought from my 7:00 next. I have got from this five years. I know better and better to from these five years, right? OK. So better
one, not better, to better one squared. So the square term is used to see whether there is any non linearity. OK, five 3D Sei is the resident variance from the better decoration? OK, so I put that in also and then I expect this NIT to be clean. OK, and
now I can test. Weather Sigma 3P is equal to 0 or residual risk does not affect return Sigma 2T is equal to zero. There are no non linearity in the security market line and five one T is greater than zero. There is a positive price of risk. OK. Five 3T
is not different from zero. 5 Two is not different from zero, but five one is greater than zero, but there's less than RM minus RF, so no. I have a much bigger test. Only thing is that you understand how is better generated. Because. I'm using past data,
get my letters and then I'm using this better than the next four years. OK, OK to see. Well, then, these better than returns. I can get OK over the next few years, but the better I've got from the earlier times. OK. And see whether I can test this. OK.
So this is very much like. I have an initial window where I found my. Then I get my betters and then I use all this information over the next four years and four years, meaning how many they have monthly returns, right? So they have each year they have
12. Returns right, so for years, so that is 48 times. OK OK no. And you will do this each month over the next four years, so you will do it 40 at times. OK, and then you. This. Alright, and see whether. But the story that is implicit in the CIP M actually.
Hello. Is the scariest what has been done? It takes a little bit off if you read your email paper. Of course it is much better explain there it is well explained Informer in French 2004 as well, but you will have to use a little bit of imagination that
that we have this. Over these years. There's cutting it into three parts. Each part is performing a function. First I have My Portfolio. So that helps me get the precise estimate of better. So the precise estimate of beta is then formed in the next part
of the of the data set, and then the returns for the next 4 years. I am using the better that I have estimated earlier. Whether they be the. The implications of the CDM according to any questions here, I want to I want to just stop a little bit here are
you. Are you now getting a idea about what these people did? So I'm finding it very hard to understand the empirical framework that form in French is trying to like explain so and like one more thing. So is it possible that we can do in practical in class
so that will have hands-on experience on these models? How to fillet a portfolio index enter? Yes. I'm sure that most. Better standard software that is actually available. OK, I also what is important for us is portfolio theory. How to get those numbers
are not all that important. OK, in the sense that how will you form a portfolio? Oh yeah, now you would have to take 1000. Funds or what they were. OK, you have to download. Play returns weekly returns or whatever he I assure you, it is a very very tedious
job. OK, an unless. For example, you can just go to any website that analyzes portfolios. And you can really get the portfolio better from there. There are many sites that will give you the better for each form. OK, no days. New paper. He changed the
portfolio returns will change. This is the dynamic thing. OK, uh, So what this empirical strategy is using is. Firstly. I need to form a port for you to get a quote for you. Better be cause a portfolio. More precisely defined. And therefore can be more
precisely estimated. Why? Because the variance of returns is much lower in airport. Hold on, I have to solve the problem. How do I get My Portfolio so I choose the initial some years of my game? That is 7 years of the data used to form portfolios. OK
so I I calculate beta rank them. OK, and then from this. Portfolios? OK then I have to calculate the portfolio returns. OK. And based on this, portfolio returns and the market portfolio. I then have to get estimates of better again. OK, well I know this
estimator better is really going to be very very precise. OK, OK. And then having these estimates of better, I'm going to use returns over the next four years. With these bettors data for me. OK, to run this regression and make the test. Are you understanding
what we're doing now? Because this betters are my independent variables, right? Which I have got from five years of data. Seven years of data are used to make portfolios. Five years of data are used to get their betters. And the next 40 years I'm using
the returns. OK, with you observed bettas because these are monthly regressions right? So for each month you will get the band. And then you are going to do these regressions to. Best weather this. 5 not 515253 RO Or whatever it is greater than mine or
whatever it is now. You should appreciate me. Seriousness of these calculations. Oh, it is all very well to say that I want to actually do it. OK, there have been OK. I can think of at least three PhD thesis is that I've gone on these lines. OK, and they
are there in our library. For you to get a handle on the tediousness of the computational work that is required to do this. OK, so it is not feasible to replicate these papers so easy. You have to invest a huge amount of time. Which obviously in class
like this we do not have. So your best bet is to figure out what these guys have now. And strategies are a little involved. Why? Because the statistical issues are a little involved. OK, so so we're having enthusiasm to actually do all this estimation
by yourself is commendable. But right from creation of the data. Which is not such a big deal now cause data can be downloaded very easily. OK to formation of portfolios. This that and the other is. In all trivial exercise. OK, so it's been very very.
Ambitious to say that I'm going to do this by myself. Oh Let me assure you that it is not. OK, I can assure you that it is not what we need to understand this. Can we make sense of the empirical methodology that is used? Remember, open assumption is that
there is a distribution of returns out there. OK, and. We need to have an empirical strategy where. I want vectors are precisely define. In the sensor not define are precisely estimated. OK, so the first step is that the estimate for is single asset data
is likely to be very noisy. So I need to move to our portfolio. How do I move to their portfolio based on betters? OK, so I use the initial years to estimate the weight as I know that these battles are noisy, but then I rank these forms according to their
betters. Or remember, they're using seven years of data, so they're averaging out over 7 years 7 into 12 is how much? OK, so. So that averaging procedure. Is drowning out the noise that is likely to be there on each asset? And then. Coming what my portfolios,
I'm using the next five years to generate the papers. Which is better for me? OK, and the returns I'm taking. So. Sorry, turns off the next four years. OK, better generated over the last. Five years. OK, and then I'm running this. OK. Are you understanding
now what has been done? Is that OK? That is why I said, You know, when you when you go back to the. Find my best paper. It's if they nominally tedious read because you will get a little lost in trying to understand what has been done. OK, so so this is
a a virtualized. Is summary of. OK, but I will upload the paper you can. You can take any confusion about what we're saying, what we are. What is not clear? So you have to think about it step by step. Show you something you're not here. We will go over
it again. OK, but but the interpretations of these coefficients must be cleared. OK, my CPM tells me that this fight two must be zero and why is there a tea? Because there are 12 months of the year, right? Do you understand what is happening? So for January
there will be one story of February. There will be another, so you will do this again and again, and again and again. You will get many bettors here OK. Right? Yeah. Then risk return our fit month by month for the remaining four years so you will get
48 regressions. For each month of the remaining four years. Because you have, you have a better for each of the months, right? Which is supposed to be constant? Why? Because you have used. The last five years to get to that better. Not change if your
distribution is stable, you understand. So I phoned my portfolios first. OK, then I get to my independent variable that is my bathrooms. I don't last for your. For example, I use these battles, which I assume are not going to change over 12 months of
the year. Remember, I will get well better. OK then, for each month I'm doing a cross section exercise and arriving at 48 better eyes. For the last. 40 years for the remaining four years is that clear there or is there still some confusion here? Can I
go ahead at any any question? Yeah. Any specific question or anything that is not clear? Maybe when you read the paper you can have. Maybe there will be more. So can I go ahead or is there anything you want me to go back to? Are you there with me also?
So in the previous slide, we say that we create the portfolios by ranking the individual securities on the basis of their details. But prior to that, we just mentioned that The Beatles of individual securities are not as accurate or not really accurate
present at the ranking. That will create it might have some errors as well. Of course there will be errors. So how many years of data are used to create the portfolios? Yes, Sir. So what are we doing? Seven in two. 12 is how much? 84 Alright. So we're
using. Notice that the largest amount of years are being used to create the portfolios. You are very right that for each individual security that better is very imprecise, correct? Is that for a portfolio that better is going to be much more precise,
correct? Yes, Sir. Right? So I know that there are going to be a lot of errors for individual bypass. So I want to move to A. So notice that the largest amount of data is being used to form the portfolio, so they're trying to. So if I use more data, the
power of. Best go up very much. And the end becomes quite large, correct? Because for each month I'm getting a better and then trying to average that out and then I'm ranking everything and creating My Portfolio, you understand. So for each month I have
a better for each security. So then I have it over seven months. I'm sorry for over 7 years for each security I have so many observations. I have so many battles, not observations. Those better. I'm averaging, you understand. And then arriving at a better
for a farm. And then I'm ranking them and then I'm creating My Portfolio. So I'm trying to be. Trying to get the best estimate that is possible of these betterson and make the best part for you is possible. You see the logic. Yes, having done this. No,
I want to use these portfolios to get it better, better, right? So I'm using the next five years to form the initial. All the battles. So now this portfolio returns. I will regress against the. Market on that is off of a market portfolio. Like an SNP
$500. Everything else like in India, the nifty 50. Correct? Yes. Night, so now for this portfolios, understand regression. OK. And get my betters. These better now become my data over the next four years. But that he returns over the next four years.
I have, right? OK, because these portfolios you can figure out that it turns over the next four years, right? No problem. OK, you never calculate this portfolio returns based on the returns that you observe for those four years. And then booties regressions
again. And use this equation. Alrighty is equal to 530 + 5 and for each month. Are you understanding now? And then risk and return are fit month by month for the remaining. Taken from the five years earlier. OK and returns are generated with data for
the next. For the last four years. OK, yeah is that fine? Are you controlling for the residual variance from the bitter aggression? Why do you think? Because this restaurant regression, this residual variance will be 0, No? The coefficient of it. Yes.
So you can now test for it, no? Well, 'cause if it is not zero then you are. Violating the assumptions under which the regressions can be. Do you see the point? You expect this variance. To repeat over the next four years, right? Because they they return
distribution is the same out there, correct? That is not changing. Did you see the point? Yes. Right? So just one more clarification. Is it for US market or. This this kind of work is available for the Indian market. Set the thing that you said key. We
can also do this across the world. Now the model. Made by by the author of this paper. Yeah. Principle, if you must consider human capital housing and consumer durables. But you don't. In the same vein, why should you restrict yourself only to the US
market or to the Indian market? Be cause investors can shift over markets much more easily now then shouldn't you consider the whole world as your? Portfolio space. Is that right? But but nobody does that. So. And possibly you are getting errors because
you're not doing that you understand. So, so the cursor only flagging. Problem points. I think even after all this that we're doing, there are still some problems that we have not been able to take care of. Are you understanding what you say? But there
saying we're not taking care of all the problems in the world that such regressions may have. We're only solving the problems that the data allows us to solve. Those problems that the data does not allow us to solve this. Thank you. We can't do anything
about. Clear. Yes, so having flag issue does not necessarily mean that they have to deal with it. Actually, they don't so. OK what what what we need to understand is the logic of this equation, RIT. Fight not be 5 one T52T530 and that error town. OK.
And based on that we can test whether R3T is equal to zero. That is legible days does not affect return 5. Two T is equal to zero. There is no non linearity in the security market line because if you find a non linearity, this immediately rejects the
CPM out of no. Because that line is supposed to be a straight line, correct? OK. 520 there has to be a positive price of risk that is higher the better. Hire the return that that relationship must be there. OK. OK. Yeah. Is that fine? Shall we go ahead?
You see all the tests that can be done. Chica any questions? Still confusion, I'm willing to solve every confusion that. Of course my dad, I need to be clear, but you know, to the extent that I'm clear I can solve. Yes, it will read the paper and get
back to you. OK so can I go ahead now quickly. We have only 5 minutes left, so. OK, so find out is generally greater than others, so now. So if the equilibrium model described market conditions that an individual securities deviation model should contain
no. A positive residual value for anyone stock and any moment should convey no information about the differential performance. There should be no correlation with any lag between this. All these things were vindicated. So when we are saying all these
things are indicated by the data, what are we saying? 53P0 OK. 5 two T is. 0. And the error term is well behaved. Are you seeing the point? When I make. These two statements. This was vindicated by the theater. You can test this right no problem. The
standard residual test will tell you. Clearly only test we get this year PM. There is a positive relation between better and never return, but it is too quiet. Sports that you get. What kind of sports that are left? So when we draw diagram. Nice. What?
The best thing with your data. Being like things to be 2 flag. OK, there is a positive relation. But it is too flat. OK, it is true. No. You will be the paper. The numbers are given, but yeah. The cross section regression predicts that the intercept term
is the risk free rate and the coefficient and better is expected market return in excess of the risk. But the results showed that the intercept term is greater than the risk period. That is the return on the moment one month TV, right so? So the return
one month people let each month is known to you, right? OK, and you always find the intercept term is greater than that risk period significant. Because that is the standard test that you can do right 'cause they they risk free rate, you know, and you
have the estimate of the constant and then you can see whether that constant is significantly different from. Which is the people this error standard test in economics? The boy we'll do better is less than the average excess market return. Average return
on a portfolio of US. 4 minus sleeping so. It starts, you know. By doing this phenomenally difficult empirical exercise. Yeah, that seems to be a little heartbreaking though. You know it is linear, so that's a great thing. The editor store my phone. That's
a great thing, but. But when it comes to the constant and coefficient of better things, start going on in the same. You want to approximate a risk free rate. And the coefficient of that better is. Not the kind that you will like. It will give you a good
slope, it's too flat. OK. I think we can stop here. I think all of you must go and read. Comma in French. I will try and put the original paper also. From where this this I have taken and then you can go and see that as well. I can assure you that this
reading is going to be tedious, especially of the original paper. But if this has. Set your imagination going. Please read them. OK, so. So. We will carry on from here in the next class. I have not yet decided when the next class is going to be. I know
promise I jested that I try and buy a better Internet connection on Geo. I'm going to try and do that an upgrade and let me see what happens if my class is not successful on Wednesday then we will take it to a Friday evening or Saturday Saturday afternoon.
But I will let let us see what happens. OK, OK so. OK. Very few people attending class now we're getting into very difficult papers so. I'm not sure. Why this is happening? 3 nine and four only, only 13 people are attending class. So it is going to be
a challenge for those who have attended class to read the papers that I'm now going to recommend an slowly slowly the level of difficulty is going to keep rising. Oh So I'm a little worried about. Set up I have a I mean suggestion or question on the examination
bits and examine. Set like the questions were true, false questions. So if I was also there. Patient was also there, so how will we be rewarded way it will should be on the merit of the explanation, not just to prove false or uncertain. That is very.
Something that I feel that you must get right. OK, OK so I will see I have not seen the. Our subscription. I got them only on Saturday, right? And I have not seen them yet, so let me see them and we can have a talk on each question later. OK. I will be
sending them back to you with the marks on them. So that's OK. Question mark and possibly. With my marking, send it back to you. Or I could write an email saying for this question you've got so much fun. So you will have copies of your answer scripts.
So there is no need for me to give you back your answer script and you can just check for each question what I have. OK, thank you Sir. Only comment is that the number of attendees is too small and the the level of difficulty of the papers that we are
going to discuss from henceforward is likely to increase as we go ahead, so that worries me a little bit, so that's the only thing. OK, so all the best and thank you if there is no other question I can hang up. Thank you Sir. Thank you Sir. Thank you
Sir.</p>
